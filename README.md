# cricketing managerial db system
After developing this project, I have realized the importance of object role modeling and how it can be an extremely effective tool to create databases that can provide tremendous amounts of ease to various applications in our day-to-day lives. Through this approach, my aim was to decrease data redundancy and increase database connectivity. I have integrated various database concepts such as triggers, stored procedures, and user defined functions. I have added various functionalities to my model using the concepts of buckets, JSON structures, Couchbase. The project is still in its early stages, which means there are many more features to be added to enhance existing features. It is possible to use data prediction to help selectors pick teams without having to examine each player's stats individually. The system currently lacks a user interface, so users would need to have a working knowledge of SQL and databases.
